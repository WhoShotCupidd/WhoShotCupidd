### Hey there 👋

 - I'm currently a fourth-year student at the University of Alberta studying Mathematics with a Specialization in Computing Science. My interests are embedded systems, designing operating systems, and compiler optimization.

 - Currently working on designing an operating system forked off of raspberry-pi OS to design a system capable of high levels of redundancy during a rocket launch environment (In partnership with STARR (Student Team for Alberta Rocketry Research) and the University of Alberta)

 - Previous project I completed for my club was designing the codebase for the launch in 2023 for more information click [here](https://github.com/UASTARR/Arduino_BIOME_Code)
